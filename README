#Workshop Web Application project.
It was my first time with Django framework.
It was also my first time with Python back-end, and first time with
front-end development ever! So please, be merciful. I realize that
this project may contain too many unforgiven "mistakes" or rather
convention that doesn't follow the python's style guide.
I have never coded in Python before.
This project was made in two weeks. Ended at the 23th of January, 2017.
Project doesn't contain automatic setup file, like one from Django's
documentation tutorial. All you have to do is to start a new project
in Django environment and copy all data from the .zip file to the folder.
It has open-source license so feel free to use this project.

Regards, YellowMatt.
